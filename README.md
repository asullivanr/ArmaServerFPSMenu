Built with <a href="https://github.com/BrettMayson/HEMTT">HEMTT</a> in mind.

Load the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asullivanr/ArmaServerFPSMenu/refs/heads/main/initServer.sqf">initServer.sqf</a> file into your mission folder and change SevFPS_allowedUIDs to include a list of people allowed to access the menu, or change SevFPS_globalAllow to true to allow everyone to use the menu.

From 35 fps and above the text color will be green.
From 30-35 it will be orange.
and anything below 30 will be red.
